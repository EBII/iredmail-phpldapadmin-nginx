# iredmail-phpldapadmin
phpLDAPAdmin template for an iRedMail Server<br/><br/>

It is assumed that you have installed `iRedMail` with `nginx` webserver and `OpenLDAP` backend. Also it is assumed that you have installed `phpLDAPAdmin` in `/usr/share/phpldapadmin`. <br/>
So, by using these scripts you would able to access your OpenLDAP within your server, without opening ldap port for external access. <br/><br/>

Good Luck!
